Belly Button Biodiversity Interactive Dashboard
This project is an interactive dashboard that explores the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels. The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species, known as operational taxonomic units (OTUs), were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. The dashboard allows users to visualize and explore the top 10 OTUs found in each individual's navel.
